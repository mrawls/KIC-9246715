\section{Oscillation modes fit with \textsc{D\large{iamonds}}}
\label{appendix}

In this appendix, we present the frequencies fit by \textsc{D\large{iamonds}} \citep{cor14}, as described in Section \ref{subsubsec_mixed}. We follow the methodology for the peak bagging analysis of a red giant star in \citet{cor15}. Each fit mode's frequency together with its angular degree \ell, azimuthal order $m$, amplitude or height, linewidth (when applicable), and probability of detection is listed in Table \ref{appendixtable}. Figure \ref{fig:appendixfig} shows these modes superimposed on the power density spectrum of KIC 9246715, which is split up like an \'echelle diagram for clarity. For comparison, we also plot the locations of where modes should fall according to the asymptotic relation \citep{mos12} for the main set of oscillations ($\Delta \nu = 8.31 \ \mu \rm{Hz}$) and the marginally detected second set of oscillations ($\Delta \nu = 8.60 \ \mu \rm{Hz}$). The power spectrum is quite noisy overall, exhibits wide modes with low amplitudes, and is challenging to interpret unambiguously. For a full discussion, see Section \ref{discuss}.
