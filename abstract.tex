We combine \emph{Kepler} photometry with ground-based spectra to present a comprehensive photodynamical model for the double red giant eclipsing binary KIC 9246715. The two stars are very similar in mass ($M_1 = 2.16 \pm 0.04\ M_{\odot}$, $M_2 = 2.14 \pm 0.03\ M_{\odot}$) and radius ($R_1 = 7.90 \pm 0.04 \ R_{\odot}$, $R_2 = 8.33 \pm 0.04 \ R_{\odot}$) in a well-separated and eccentric ($e = 0.35$) 171-day orbit, yet an asteroseismic analysis identifies only a single set of solar-like oscillations. The oscillation amplitudes are weaker than expected from similar red giants. Because the two stars are nearly twins, KIC 9246715 is a difficult target for a precise test of the asteroseismic scaling relations, which yield $M_{\rm{seismo}} = 2.17 \pm 0.13 \ M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm{seismo}} = 8.26 \pm 0.16 \ R_{\odot}$. Both Star 1 and Star 2 are consistent with the single inferred asteroseismic mass, but the asteroseismic radius agrees within $2 \sigma$ of Star 2's radius only. We therefore suspect the oscillating star is Star 2, the slightly larger of the pair. We show evidence for stellar activity and modest tidal forces, which are likely responsible for a lack of solar-like oscillations in one star and weak oscillations in the other. This system is a useful asteroseismic case study and paves the way for a detailed analysis of more red giants in eclipsing binaries.
