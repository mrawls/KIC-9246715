\subsection{Stellar parameters}\label{parameters}
We use the radiative transfer code MOOG \citep{sne73} to derive $T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and metallicity [Fe/H] for the disentangled spectrum of each star in KIC 9246715. First, we use the Automatic Routine for line Equivalent widths in stellar Spectra \citep[ARES,][]{Sousa_2007} with the Fe I and Fe II linelist from \citet{Yong_2005}. ARES automatically measures equivalent widths for spectral lines which can then be used by MOOG. An excellent outline of the process is given by \citet{Sousa_2014}.

We find xx Fe I and xx Fe II lines in the xxx range of the spectrum Star 1, and xx Fe I and xx Fe II lines for Star 2's spectrum.
