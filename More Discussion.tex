\subsection{Stellar activity and rotation}\label{actrot}
The double red giant eclipsing binary KIC 9246715 is an interesting system with photometric variations from stellar activity and a very eccentric orbit given its age, long orbital period, and well-separated nature. In this section, we discuss how stellar activity and tidal forces have likely interacted over the binary's lifetime to arrive at the system we see today.

DISCUSS FIGURES \ref{fig:emission1} AND \ref{fig:emission2}. COMPARE MAGNETIC SENSITIVE LINES TO MAGNETIC NON-SENSITIVE LINES... ZEEMAN BROADENING? ALSO TALK ABOUT H-ALPHA BROADNESS/EMISSION/WEIRDNESS AND POSSIBLE CA II EMISSION. \citep{sis70,har73}

Discuss vsini things.
