This paper is based on data gathered with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium. This paper includes data collected by the \emph{Kepler} mission. Funding for the \emph{Kepler} mission is provided by the NASA Science Mission directorate. Some/all of the data presented in this paper were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. Support for MAST for non-HST data is provided by the NASA Office of Space Science via grant NNX13AC07G and by other grants and contracts. This research made use of Astropy, a community-developed core Python package for Astronomy \citep{astropy}. This work made use of PyKE \citep{pyke}, a software package for the reduction and analysis of \emph{Kepler} data. This open source software project is developed and distributed by the NASA \emph{Kepler} Guest Observer Office. This research has made use of NASA's Astrophysics Data System Bibliographic Services. This research has made use of the AstroBetter blog and wiki.
