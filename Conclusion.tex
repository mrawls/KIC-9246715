\section{Conclusions}\label{conclude}
{\textbf{You should say somewhere that we will try in a second paper to disentangle oscillations modes of both stars, based on accurate peak bagging using Bayesian methods, and invert the measured frequency to unambiguously model the systems with the help of MESA + GYRE}}.

We have characterized the double red giant eclipsing binary KIC 9246715 with a combination of dynamical modeling, stellar atmosphere modeling, and global asteroseismology, and have investigated the roles of magnetic activity, tidal forces, and stellar evolution in creating the system we observe today. KIC 9246715 represents a likely future state of similar-mass RG/EB systems and raises interesting questions about the interactions among stellar activity, tides, and solar-like oscillations.

The two stars in KIC 9246715 are nearly twins ($M_1 = 2.16 \pm 0.04\ M_{\odot}$, $M_2 = 2.14 \pm 0.03\ M_{\odot}$, $R_1 = 7.90 \pm 0.04 \ R_{\odot}$, $R_2 = 8.33 \pm 0.04 \ R_{\odot}$), yet we observe only one pair of solar-like oscillations ($M = 2.17 \pm 0.13 \ M_{\odot}$, $R = 8.26 \pm 0.16 \ R_{\odot}$). We find that the oscillations are most likely from Star 2, the larger and cooler of the pair, which appears to be less magnetically active than Star 1. Surface gravities from dynamical modeling ($\log g_1 = 2.977 \pm 0.004$, $\log g_2 = 2.927 \pm 0.003$) and asteroseismology ($\log g = 2.942 \pm 0.007$) nearly agree, while the surface gravity from stellar atmosphere modeling is higher ($\log g_1 = 3.21 \pm 0.45$, $\log g_2 = 3.33 \pm 0.37$). A similar discrepancy was found in a population study comparing asteroseismic and spectroscopic surface gravities of giant stars, but the physical cause is uncertain.

The stars in KIC 9246715 were born and evolved together, but the present evolutionary state is unclear. Tidal circularization timescales and radii from a stellar evolution model indicate that both stars should be on the red giant branch with an age of $7.28 \times 10^8$ years, while the oscillation mode period spacing---which is difficult to measure due to a weak and noisy oscillation spectrum---suggests the oscillating star is on the red clump. Future work will examine this disagreement in more detail with precise ``peak-bagging'' of individual oscillation modes.

Red giants are ideal tools for probing the Milky Way Galaxy via asteroseismology, so it is crucial that we understand the accuracy and precision of asteroseismically-derived physical parameters. Along the same lines, more than half of cool stars should be in binary or multiple systems, so galactic studies must be done carefully due to external influences of binarity on solar-like oscillations. Detailed studies of the handful of known RG/EBs are crucial to ensure we understand these galactic beacons. Future work will characterize the other known oscillating RG/EBs as well as several non-oscillating RG/EBs. These have the potential to become some of the best-studied stars while simultaneously helping us better understand the structure of the Milky Way.
