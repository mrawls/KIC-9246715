\section{Physical parameters from light curve \& radial velocities}\label{model}
To derive physical and orbital parameters for KIC 9246715, we use the Eclipsing Light Curve (ELC) code \citep{oro00}. ELC employs photodynamical modeling with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain optimizer to simultaneously solve for a suite of stellar parameters. It is able to consider any set of input constraints simultaneously, i.e., a combination of light curves and radial velocities, and can use a full treatment of Roche geometry \citep{kop69,avn75}. It uses the NextGen model atmospheres integrated over a specified filter (in this case, the relatively broad ``white-light'' \emph{Kepler} bandpass). ELC uses $\chi^2$ as a measure of fitness to refine a best-fit model:
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi^2 & = &
\sum_i \frac{ (f_{\rm{mod}}(\phi_i; \ {\bf a}) - f_{\rm{obs}}(\rm{\it{Kepler}}))^2 }{\sigma_i^2(\rm{\it{Kepler}})} \\
& + & \sum_i \frac{ (f_{\rm{mod}}(\phi_i; \ {\bf a}) - f_{\rm{obs}}(\rm{RV_1}))^2 }{\sigma_i^2(\rm{RV_1})} \\
& + & \sum_i \frac{(f_{\rm{mod}}(\phi_i; \ {\bf a}) - f_{\rm{obs}}(\rm{RV_2}))^2}{\sigma_i^2(\rm{RV_2})},
\end{eqnarray}

where $f_{\rm{mod}}(\phi_i; \ {\bf a})$ is the ELC model flux at a given phase $\phi_i$ for a set of parameters ${\bf a}$, $f_\rm{obs}$ is the observed value at the same phase, and $\sigma_i$ is the associated uncertainty.

To characterize the binary, we compute two sets of ELC models. The first uses all eclipses from the light curve together with all radial velocity points and employ ELC's ``fast analytic mode.'' This and subsequent models use the equations in \citet{man02} to treat both stars as spheres, which is reasonable for a well-detached binary like KIC 9246715. We use the parameters from this model to inform the spectral disentangling process described in Section \ref{atm}. The second set of ELC models breaks the light curves into segments to investigate how stellar activity affects the results.

\subsection{All-eclipse ELC model}

We use ELC to solve for 16 parameters: orbital period $P_{orb}$, zeropoint $T_{conj}$ (this sets the primary eclipse to orbital phase $\phi_{ELC} = 0.5$ instead of $\phi = 0$), orbital inclination $i$, $e \sin \omega$ and $e \cos \omega$ (where $e$ is eccentricity and $\omega$ is the longitude of periastron), the temperature of the primary star $T_1$, the mass of the primary star $M_1$, the amplitude of the primary star's radial velocity curve $K_1$, the fractional radii of each star $R_1/a$ and $R_2/a$ (where $a$ is the average orbital seperation), the temperature ratio $T_2/T_1$, the \emph{Kepler} contamination factor, and stellar limb darkening parameters for the quadratic limb darkening law. Because all binaries obey the relation
\begin{equation}
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{K_2}{K_1},
\end{equation}
the ELC model includes masses and radii for both stars. Error bars for each fit parameter are estimated by scaling the measured error values so that $\chi^2 \sim N$, where $N$ is the number of data points in one of three data sets (light curve of the binary, radial velocity of Star 1, and radial velocity of Star 2). We then assign one-sigma errors for each parameter corresponding to the value that gives $\Delta \chi^2$ equal to the minimum $\chi^2$. The results for the all-eclipse ELC model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ELCresult} and presented in the ``All-eclipse model'' column of Table \ref{table1}.
