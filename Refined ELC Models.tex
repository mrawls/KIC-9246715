\subsection{``Chunk'' ELC models}
Write about each ``chunk'' being modeled separately. Everything is the same except only one pair of primary/secondary eclipse per chunk. There are eight of them. The final model parameters are presented in REFER TO TABLE.

\begin{itemize}
\item Put a table here with model parameter values.
\item Present how the ``chunk'' results differ from the full dataset results.
\end{itemize}
