\subsection{``Chunk'' ELC Models}
Write about each ``chunk'' being modeled separately. Everything is the same except only one pair of primary/secondary eclipse per chunk. There are eight of them. The final model parameters are presented in TABLE BELOW, and illustrated in FIGURE BELOW.

\begin{itemize}
\item Put a table here with final model values. Mostly from the All-Eclipse model, but also with highlights (extremes?) from the chunk models. OR maybe it's better as two tables? Figure that out.
\item FIGURE HERE highlighting how one or more chunk fits deviates from the All-Eclipse fit.
\end{itemize}
