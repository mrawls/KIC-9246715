\subsection{``Chunk'' ELC models}
To investigate secular changes in KIC 9246715, we split the \emph{Kepler} light curve into eight ``chunks'' such that each contains one primary and one secondary eclipse.
More details coming soon.

\begin{itemize}
\item Put a table here with model parameter values.
\item Present how the ``chunk'' results differ from the full dataset results.
\end{itemize}
