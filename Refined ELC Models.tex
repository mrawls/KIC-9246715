\subsection{Refined ELC Models}
Write about each ``chunk'' being modeled separately and how we can now fix the temperatures from the atmosphere modeling... or at least give them very little wiggle room. Fewer free parameters is always good.
The final model parameters are presented in TABLE BELOW, and illustrated in FIGURE BELOW.

\begin{itemize}
\item Put a table here with final model values
\item FIGURE HERE with final model fit (for one characteristic chunk)... and maybe an inset or other portion of the figure showing the difference between it and the funny spot chunk.
\end{itemize}
