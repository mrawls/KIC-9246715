\label{fig:ELCresult} ELC model for all eclipses of KIC 9246715 taken together. The top two panels show the folded radial velocities, while the middle two panels show the folded light curve. A single full orbit is shown. The bottom four panels are a zoom of each eclipse. Residuals are indicated by a $\Delta$ symbol. Red and yellow points are observations and the black line is the overall ELC model fit. The primary and secondary eclipses are the same configurations as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:keplerfig}.
