\label{fig:ELCresult} ELC model for all eclipses of KIC 9246715 taken together. The top two panels show the folded radial velocities, while the middle two panels show the folded light curve. A single full orbit is shown. The bottom four panels are a zoom of each eclipse. Red and yellow points are observations and the black line is the overall ELC model fit. The primary and secondary eclipses are the same configurations as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:keplerfig}.
