\label{fig:ELCresult} ELC model for the full KIC 9246715 dataset. The top two panels show the folded radial velocities, the middle two panels show the folded light curve, and the bottom four panels are a zoom of each eclipse. Red and yellow points are observations and the black line is the model fit. WILL UPDATE THIS WITH THE LATEST FIGURE.
