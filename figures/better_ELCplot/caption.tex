\label{fig:ELCresult} ELC model for all eclipses of KIC 9246715 taken together. The top two panels show the folded radial velocities, the middle two panels show the folded light curve, and the bottom four panels are a zoom of each eclipse. Red and yellow points are observations and the black line is the model fit. Primary and Secondary eclipses are the same as in Figure \ref{fig:keplerfig}.
