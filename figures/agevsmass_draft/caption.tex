\label{fig:mesa} Ages for a suite of MESA stellar evolution models for stars of different masses. Color indicates the evolutionary state of a star as it moves from the Main Sequence (MS) $\rightarrow$ Red Giant Branch (RGB) $\rightarrow$ Secondary Red Clump/Horizontal Branch (HB) $\rightarrow$ Asymptotic Giant Branch and beyond (AGB+). \revise{Lines of constant radius equal to $R_1$ and $R_2$ that fall within the one-sigma errors in mass are shown (gray, $R_1 \pm \sigma$ corresponding to $M_1 \pm \sigma$; white, $R_2 \pm \sigma$ corresponding to $M_2 \pm \sigma$). All models assume a mixing-length parameter of $\alpha = 2.5$. It is possible for both stars in KIC 9246715 to be the same age on the HB, but not on the RGB.}
