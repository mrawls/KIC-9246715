\label{fig:mesa} Ages for a suite of simple stellar evolution models for stars ranging from 2.04 to 2.26 $M_{\odot}$ in increments of 0.02. Color indicates the evolutionary state of each star as it moves from the Main Sequence (MS) --> Red Giant Branch (RGB) --> Secondary Red Clump/Horizontal Branch (HB) --> Asymptotic Giant Branch and beyond (AGB+). Two blue lines corresponding to the radii of Star 1 (solid, $R = 7.90 \ R_\odot$) and Star 2 (dashed, $R = 8.33 \ R_\odot$) are shown. This suggests that the two stars in KIC 9246715 (with masses $2.16$ and $2.14 \ M_\odot$, respectively) are both on the RGB and have a coeval history.
