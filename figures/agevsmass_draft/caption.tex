\label{fig:mesa} Ages for a suite of MESA stellar evolution models for stars of different masses, incremented by $0.01 \ M_\odot$. Color indicates the evolutionary state of each star as it moves from the Main Sequence (MS) $\rightarrow$ Red Giant Branch (RGB) $\rightarrow$ Secondary Red Clump/Horizontal Branch (HB) $\rightarrow$ Asymptotic Giant Branch and beyond (AGB+). Two nearly-overlapping lines corresponding to the radius of each star are shown (solid black, $R_1 = 7.90 \ R_\odot$; dashed blue, $R_2 = 8.33 \ R_\odot$), along with vertical lines corresponding to $M_1 = 2.16 \ M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 2.14 \ M_\odot$. This suggests the stars in KIC 9246715 are both on the RGB, because they would need larger radii to be on the HB. Given the uncertainty in mass (0.03--0.04 $M_\odot$), it is possible for both stars to be the same age on the RGB.
