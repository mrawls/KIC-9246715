\label{fig:mesa} Ages for a suite of MESA stellar evolution models for stars of different masses. Color indicates the evolutionary state of a star as it moves from the Main Sequence (MS) $\rightarrow$ Red Giant Branch (RGB) $\rightarrow$ Secondary Red Clump/Horizontal Branch (HB) $\rightarrow$ Asymptotic Giant Branch and beyond (AGB+). \revise{Lines of constant radius corresponding to $R_1$ and $R_2$ that fall within the one-sigma errors in mass are shown (white, $R_1$ between $2.163$ and $2.177 \ M_\odot$; gray, $R_2$ between $2.141$ and $2.155 \ M_\odot$) for two different values of the mixing-length parameter ($\alpha = 2$, bottom; $\alpha = 2.5$, top). It is possible for both stars in KIC 9246715 to be the same age on either the RGB or HB, depending on the mixing-length parameter chosen.}
