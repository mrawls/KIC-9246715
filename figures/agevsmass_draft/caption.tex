\label{fig:mesa} Ages for a suite of simple stellar evolution models for stars ranging from 2.04 to 2.26 $M_{\odot}$ in increments of 0.02. Color indicates the evolutionary state of each star as it moves from the Main Sequence (MS) $\rightarrow$ Red Giant Branch (RGB) $\rightarrow$ Secondary Red Clump/Horizontal Branch (HB) $\rightarrow$ Asymptotic Giant Branch and beyond (AGB+). Two blue lines corresponding to the radii of Star 1 (solid, $R = 7.90 \ R_\odot$) and Star 2 (dashed, $R = 8.33 \ R_\odot$) are shown. This suggests that the two stars in KIC 9246715 (with masses $2.16$ and $2.14 \ M_\odot$, respectively) are both on the RGB and have a coeval history.

\textbf{JEAN: PLEASE PROVIDE AN UPDATED VERSION OF THIS FIGURE WITH A SUITE OF MASS-VARYING MODELS GENERATED THE SAME WAY AS YOUR \verbatim{`LOGS_9246715_star2_ov_2'} MESA RUN. INCLUDE VERTICAL LINES DENOTING $M_1$ AND $M_2$. THE AGES WILL BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, BUT THE FIGURE AS IT APPEARS PRESENTLY IS QUALITATIVELY CORRECT.}
