\label{fig:mesa} Ages for a suite of stellar evolution models for stars ranging from 2.04 to 2.26 $M_{\odot}$ in increments of 0.02. Color indicates the evolutionary state of each star as it moves from the Main Sequence (MS) $\rightarrow$ Red Giant Branch (RGB) $\rightarrow$ Secondary Red Clump/Horizontal Branch (HB) $\rightarrow$ Asymptotic Giant Branch and beyond (AGB+). Two blue lines corresponding to the radii of Star 1 (solid, $R = 7.90 \ R_\odot$) and Star 2 (dashed, $R = 8.33 \ R_\odot$) are shown, as are two vertical lines corresponding to $M_1 = 2.16 M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 2.14 M_\odot$. This indicates that the two stars in KIC 9246715 are both on the RGB and have a coeval history. \textbf{NEW AND UPDATED FIGURE COMING SOON!}
