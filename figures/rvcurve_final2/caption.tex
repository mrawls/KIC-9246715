\label{fig:rvfig} Radial velocity curves for both stars in KIC 9246715. The top panel shows the velocities as a function of time, with a light dotted line to guide the eye. The bottom panel shows the folded radial velocity curve over one orbit. Symbol shape indicates which spectrograph took each observation.
