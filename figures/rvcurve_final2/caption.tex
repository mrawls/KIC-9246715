\label{fig:rvfig} Radial velocity curves for both stars in KIC 9246715. The top panel shows when the velocities were measured in time, while the bottom panel shows the folded radial velocity curve. As in Figure \ref{fig:keplerfig}, the data in the bottom panel are duplicated past the dotted vertical lines for clarity.
