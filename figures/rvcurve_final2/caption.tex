\label{fig:rvfig} Radial velocity curves for both stars in KIC 9246715. The top panel shows when the velocities were measured in time, with a light dotted line to guide the eye. The bottom panel shows the folded radial velocity curve over one orbit. As in Figure \ref{fig:keplerfig}, the data in the bottom panel are duplicated past the dotted vertical lines for clarity.
