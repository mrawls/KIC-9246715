\textbf{Placeholder version of figure!} Power density spectrum of KIC 11725564 (gray), a seismic ``twin'' of KIC 9246715 (red). Both power spectra were smoothed with a boxcar of 1/10 of the large separation. The modes in KIC 11725564, a secondary red clump star, have $\Delta \nu$ and $\nu_{\rm{max}}$ which very nearly match KIC 9246715. They are less noisy and have larger amplitudes than KIC 9246715, making this star a useful asteroseismic comparison.
