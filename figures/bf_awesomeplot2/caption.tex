\label{fig:bffig} Radial velocities extracted for 23 ARCES and TRES observations of KIC 9246715 with the broadening function (BF) technique. Each panel represents one spectral observation, for which the BF convolution of the target star with a template PHOENIX model spectrum is shown in black. To identify the location of each BF in radial velocity space, we fit a pair of Gaussians, which are plotted in red. The UT date of observation, orbital phase, and spectrograph used are printed in the upper left corner of each panel. Barycentric corrections have not yet been applied to these velocities.
