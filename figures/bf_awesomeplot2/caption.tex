\label{fig:bffig} Radial velocities extracted for the double-lined binary with the broadening function (BF) technique. Each panel represents one spectral observation, for which the BF is shown in black. To identify the location of each BF in radial velocity space, we fit a pair of Gaussians, which are plotted here in dark orange. The UT date of observation, orbital phase, and spectrograph used are printed in the upper left corner of each panel. Barycentric corrections have not yet been applied to these velocities.
