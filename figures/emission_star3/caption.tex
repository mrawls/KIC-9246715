\label{fig:emission1} Top of each panel: observed FDBinary extracted spectrum of Star 1 in KIC 9246715 (red) together with a stellar template (dotted black line). Bottom of each panel: difference between the model and observed spectra. Vertical lines show the position of each absorption line. Net emission in the Fe I lines indicates likely Zeeman splitting \citep{har73}. Emission in the H$\alpha$ and Ca II lines is characteristic of chromospheric magnetic activity, and the presence of an He I absorption line indicates an upper chromosphere ($T > 10000 \ \rm{K}$) is present \citep{fro12}.
