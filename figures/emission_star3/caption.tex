\label{fig:emission1} \emph{Top of each panel:} observed FDBinary-extracted spectrum of Star 1 (red) together with a stellar template (dotted black line). \emph{Bottom of each panel:} difference between the observed and model spectra. Vertical lines show the position of each absorption line. Broadened magnetic-sensitive lines would indicate Zeeman splitting, but this is not observed. Net emission in the H$\alpha$ and {\rm Ca}\kern 0.1em{\sc ii} lines is a characteristic signature of chromospheric magnetic activity, but this is not observed either. Instead, the H$\alpha$ line is deeper and broader than the model.
