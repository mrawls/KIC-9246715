\label{fig:emission1} \emph{Top of each panel:} observed FDBinary-extracted spectrum of Star 1 (red) together with a stellar template (dotted black line). \emph{Bottom of each panel:} difference between the observed and model spectra. Vertical lines show the position of each absorption line. Broadened Fe I lines indicates likely Zeeman splitting \citep{har73}. Emission in the H$\alpha$ and Ca II lines is characteristic of chromospheric magnetic activity, and the presence of an He I absorption line indicates an upper chromosphere ($T > 10000 \ \rm{K}$) must be present \citep{fro12}.
