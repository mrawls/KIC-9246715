\label{fig:seismo} Power density spectrum of KIC 9246715's \textit{Kepler} light curve (red), obtained from all available long-cadence data (Q0--Q17). The black line is a smoothed version of the red to guide the eye. Peculiarities of this oscillation spectrum are broad modes for a red giant ($\simeq0.5\ \mu$Hz instead of $\simeq0.1\ \mu$Hz), and rather low-amplitude noisy oscillation peaks.
