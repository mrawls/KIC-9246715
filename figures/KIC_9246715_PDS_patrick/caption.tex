\label{fig:seismo} Power density spectrum of KIC 9246715's \textit{Kepler} light curve (red curve), obtained by using all available data (Q0 to Q17). The black curve is a smooth of the latter to help the reader observe the modes. Peculiarities of this spectrum are broad modes for a red giant ($\simeq0.5\ \mu$Hz instead of $\simeq0.1\ \mu$Hz), and quite noisy oscillation peaks.
