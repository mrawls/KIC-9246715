\label{fig:twospectra} Disentangled spectra from FDBinary for the two stars in KIC 9246715 (red and yellow). The y-axis is offset by an arbitrary amount for clarity. For comparison, a typical observation from the ARCES spectrograph taken close to primary eclipse ($\phi = 0.982$) on 2013-09-02 is shown in black. The zoom panel is a clearer view of individual spectral features, including $\textrm{H}\alpha$, and clearly shows that the observed double-lined spectrum has been decomposed into two single-lined components. The full decomposed spectra span 5320--7120 \AA; only a portion is shown here for clarity.
