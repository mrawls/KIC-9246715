\label{fig:twospectra} Disentangled spectra from FDBinary for the two stars in KIC 9246715 (red and yellow). The y-axis is offset by an arbitrary amount for clarity. For comparison, a typical observation from the ARCES spectragraph taken close to primary eclipse is shown in black. The zoom panel is a clearer view of individual spectral features, including $\textrm{H}\alpha$, and clearly shows that the observed double-lined spectrum has been decomposed into two single-lined components.
