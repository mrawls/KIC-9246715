\label{fig:keplerfig} \emph{Kepler} light curve of the eclipsing binary KIC 9246715. Top: Detrended SAP flux over 17 quarters. The detrending process is described in Section \ref{kepler}. Middle: Folded version of the above over one orbit. Points beyond the dotted vertical lines are duplicated. Bottom: A zoomed view of secondary and primary eclipses. To avoid overlaps, each observed eclipse is offset in magnitude from the previous one. The colored disks illustrate the eclipse configuration. The red disk is "Star 1," the slightly larger and cooler of the two stars with solar-like oscillations.
