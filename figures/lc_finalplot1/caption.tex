\label{fig:keplerfig} \emph{Kepler} light curve of the eclipsing binary KIC 9246715. Top: Detrended SAP flux over 17 quarters. The detrending process is described in Section \ref{kepler}. Middle: Folded version of the above, and doubled to span from orbital phase $0-2$ for clarity. Bottom: A zoomed view of secondary and primary eclipses. Each observed eclipse is offset in magnitude from the previous one for clarity.
