\label{fig:keplerfig} \emph{Kepler} light curve of the eclipsing binary KIC 9246715. Top: Detrended SAP flux over 17 quarters. The detrending process is described in Section \ref{kepler}. Middle: Folded version of the above over one orbit. Points beyond the dotted vertical lines are duplicated. Bottom: A zoomed view of secondary and primary eclipses. To avoid overlaps, each observed eclipse is offset in magnitude from the previous one. TO ADD: CARTOON ECLIPSING STARS IN BOTTOM PANELS
