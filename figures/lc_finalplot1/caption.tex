\label{fig:keplerfig} \emph{Kepler} light curve of the eclipsing binary KIC 9246715. Top: Detrended SAP flux over 17 quarters. The detrending process is described in Section \ref{kepler}. Middle: Folded version of the above over one orbit. The dotted lines indicate the portion of the light curve used in subsequent modeling. Bottom: A zoomed view of secondary and primary eclipses corresponding to the dotted lines above. To avoid overlaps, each observed eclipse is offset in magnitude from the previous one. The colored disks illustrate the eclipse configuration. The red disk represents "Star 1," WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY LARGER AND MORE MASSIVE AND OSCILLATING BUT MAYBE NOT BECAUSE LIMB DARKENING IS ANNOYING ...
