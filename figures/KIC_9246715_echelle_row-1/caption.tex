Power spectral density of KIC 9246715 as function of frequency, in the form of an \'echelle diagram. The plain lines indicate the results from the DIAMONDS peak-bagging code. For comparison, the dashed lines show the universal pattern for an oscillator with $\Delta \nu = 8.31 \ \mu \ \rm{Hz}$, and the dotted lines with $\Delta \nu = 8.60 \ \mu \ \rm{Hz}$. Color indicates the angular degree (red is $\ell=0$, blue is $\ell=1$, and green is $\ell=2$).
