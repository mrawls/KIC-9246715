\label{fig:appendixfig}
Power spectral density (PSD) of KIC 9246715 as function of frequency, in the form of an \'echelle diagram (compare to Figure \ref{fig:echelle}). The PSD has been whitened, or divided by the background fitting, which casts the y-axis in terms of sigma. Solid blue lines indicate the universal pattern for an oscillator with $\Delta \nu = 8.31 \ \mu \rm{Hz}$ (main oscillator), while red lines indicate the same for $\Delta \nu = 8.60 \ \mu \rm{Hz}$ (marginal detection). Shaded triangles correspond to the location of fit peaks from \textsc{D\large{iamonds}} (Table \ref{appendixtable}). The width of each triangle is the mode width from the fit, and taller triangles represent higher detection confidence.
