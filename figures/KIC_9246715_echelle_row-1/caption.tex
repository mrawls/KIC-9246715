Power spectral density (PSD) of KIC 9246715 as function of frequency, in the form of an \'echelle diagram. The PSD has been whitened, or divided by the background fitting, which casts the y-axis in terms of sigma. Solid lines indicate the results from the DIAMONDS peak-bagging code. For comparison, the dashed lines show the universal pattern for an oscillator with $\Delta \nu = 8.31 \ \mu \ \rm{Hz}$, and the dotted lines with $\Delta \nu = 8.60 \ \mu \ \rm{Hz}$. Color indicates the angular degree (red is $\ell=0$, blue is $\ell=1$, and green is $\ell=2$).
