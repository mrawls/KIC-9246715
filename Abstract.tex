We present a comprehensive photodynamical model for the double red giant eclipsing binary KIC 9246715. The two evolved stars are nearly identical in mass ($M_1 = 2.16 \pm 0.04\ M_{\odot}$ and $M_2 = 2.14 \pm 0.03\ M_{\odot}$) and radius ($R_1 = 7.90 \pm 0.04 \ R_{\odot}$ and $R_2 = 8.33 \pm 0.04 \ R_{\odot}$), yet previous asteroseismic studies have identified only a single set of solar-like oscillations. Because the two stars are nearly twins, KIC 9246715 is not a good target for precisely testing the asteroseismic scaling relations---both stars in the binary agree with the single seismically-measured mass and radius ($M_{\rm{seismo}} = 2.06 \pm 0.13 \ M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm{seismo}} = 8.10 \pm 0.18 \ R_{\odot}$). We report LOTS OF OTHER COOL STUFF. Words.
